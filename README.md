# Downloads Organizer (for Windows)
![The Tool's UI on Windows](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fa68ce-2642-4cc1-9de1-77d6a0a8ce47)

This code allows the user to clean up their folder, mainly "Downloads". The tool groups file types in folders (eg. "Videos", "Documents",...). 
It also can filter how long the file hasn't been modified. For example if in the UI you enter "3 months", it will prompt a deletion popup for each file that hasn't been modified
since 3 months ago. You can then choose to delete it (goes to recycle bin) or keep it, so it can get sorted along with the rest. 

After each scan a log is created that shows you where each file went,
this way you won't lose your files if something goes wrong.
