Downloads Cleaner Script
------------------------
This Python script organizes files in the Downloads folder by categorizing them into
folders (Images, Music, Videos, Documents, and Others). It also checks if files
haven't been accessed in a specified time period (e.g., 3 months) and prompts the user
to either keep or delete them.

Features:
- Categorizes files into specific folders
- Detects old/inactive files and prompts user for deletion
- Logs all actions in a log file
- Test mode available (to simulate actions without making changes)
